// Notes: 
// Can implement streaming for very large tuples.
// The read from the memory can be made significantly faster if the tuples are memory aligned.
//     1) Because right now we use memcpy which can take 2 cpu instructions to get 1 byte of data if data is unaligned.
//     2) reinterpret_cast causes fault when fetching unaligned memory on some ARM processors and trigger an intricate time
//        consuming mechanism on most intel precessors to stick together the required memory bytes.
